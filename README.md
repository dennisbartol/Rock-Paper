</p>

<p>
Rock Paper Scissors is a simple hand game typically played between two players. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: Rock (a fist), Paper (an open hand), or Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The game follows a straightforward set of rules: Rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. The outcome of each round is determined by the chosen shapes, creating a quick and amusing decision-making process with an element of chance.
